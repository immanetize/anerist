the Anerist
=======================

Anerist is a collection of tools for assembling documentation.  It contains
modules for processing various formats and their metadata, and buildbot BuildSteps
for building them.

Anerist is currently in an exploratory state.  Don't expect to be able to use it 
in any meaningful way, other than participating in development.
